# Bank_Loan_Report
## Project Overview

The Bank Loan Report project is designed to provide a comprehensive view of loan performance across various metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for lending activities. This report includes metrics for loan applications, funding amounts, repayment amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and good/bad loan classifications, broken down by monthly trends, regional analysis, loan terms, and borrower attributes.

## Objectives
This project focused on:

•	Creating insights into key loan-related metrics and identifying trends to inform lending strategies.

•	Distinguishing between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' to assess portfolio health and mitigate risks.

•	Visualizing monthly trends, regional distributions, loan term breakdowns, employment history impacts, and loan purpose distributions.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The report assesses the following KPIs for bank loans:
### General Loan Metrics

•	Total Loan Applications: Count of all loan applications tracked Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM).

•	Total Funded Amount: Total amount disbursed, with MTD and MoM tracking.

•	Total Amount Received: Total repayments received, with MTD and MoM tracking.

•	Average Interest Rate: Monthly average interest rate, showing MoM variations.

•	Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: Monthly average DTI, with MoM changes to monitor borrower financial health.

### Good vs. Bad Loan KPIs

To assess portfolio quality, loans are categorized as:

•	Good Loans: Loans in "Fully Paid" or "Current" status.

•	Bad Loans: Loans marked as "Charged Off."

### Good Loan Metrics
Percentage and count of applications, funded amounts, and repayments received for Good Loans.

### Bad Loan Metrics

Percentage and count of applications, funded amounts, and repayments received for Bad Loans.
